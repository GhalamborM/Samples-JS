# Connecting to Databases

This example demonstrates the implementation of connections to different databases (MySQL, Firebird, MSSQL and PostgreSQL). Adapters files are in a directory with an example. You can include adapters into your projects without changes.

### Running samples
Samples folders contains all application files, including the 'index.php' file. So all files from this folder are required to be copied on your PHP server (using ftp or http access interface - depending on your hosting provider). Then, in your browser, you can go to the following address: http://you_domain_name/index.php

If you use the PHP server installed on local developers computer: http://localhost/index.php
